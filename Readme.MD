# [An Nguyen] Notes

## Outline of my approach:
- Understand the given task requirements thoroughly.
- Research the necessary knowledge to accomplish the task, SwiftUI, Firebase, ...
- Design data structure use for Firebase
- Design application architecture

## Time:
- Researching: 2h
- Implement logic with basic UI: 5h 
- Improvement UI: 1h

=> Total: 8h

## Issues: 
- Although I have extensive experience working with Swift, UIKit, and have previously worked with Android Compose (which is similar to SwiftUI), this is my first time working on a complete project using SwiftUI. Therefore, I'll need some time to familiarize myself with SwiftUI.
- Still not complete request: "As a user I can see all the notes from other users.". But I have an idea solution:
    - User A can have a secret key. And when user B search user A by username, User B must enter correct secret key to see user A's notes.
